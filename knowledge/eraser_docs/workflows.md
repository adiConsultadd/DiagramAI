# Workflow Diagrams

Workflow diagrams are used to depict processes, sequential steps, and decision points within a system. With Eraser.ioâ€™s diagram-as-code language, you can create clear and structured representations of workflows.

## Defining Workflow Steps

Each step in a workflow is represented by a node. You can assign icons, colors, and labels to clarify the purpose of each step. For example:

```plaintext
Start [icon: play]
Process [icon: gears]
Decision [icon: question]
End [icon: stop]
```

_Note:_

- Use descriptive node names and icons that best represent the step.
- Customize appearance with properties like `color` and `label` when needed.

## Grouping Workflow Stages

For processes that include multiple stages or sub-processes, group related nodes together. This helps to visualize parts of the process that belong to the same phase. For example:

```plaintext
User_Onboarding {
  Registration [icon: user-plus]
  Verification [icon: check-circle]
  Welcome [icon: smile]
}
```

_Key Points:_

- Group names must be unique.
- Grouping creates a visual boundary that clarifies the flow within a larger process.

---

## Sequential Flow

Indicate the order of operations using connection arrows. The simplest sequential workflow uses a series of nodes connected by arrows:

```plaintext
Start > Registration > Verification > Welcome > End
```

_Tip:_

- Ensure the connections clearly represent the flow of the process.

---

## Conditional Paths and Branching

Workflows often involve decisions that lead to different outcomes. Represent these scenarios by connecting a single node to multiple outcome nodes, and add labels to clarify the conditions:

```plaintext
Decision > Approved, Rejected
```

Or with labels specifying conditions:

```plaintext
Decision > Approved: If valid credentials, Rejected: If invalid
```

_Key Consideration:_

- Use labels to help stakeholders quickly understand the branching logic in the workflow.

## Example: Doctor Onboarding Flow

Below is an example workflow that shows how to onboard doctors to an appointment scheduling application:

```plaintext
Fetch_Locations [icon: map-marker]
Check_Location_Count [icon: checklist]
Add_to_Salesforce [icon: cloud-upload]
Video_Call [icon: video-camera]
WY_Questionnaire [icon: form]
Finish_Onboarding [icon: check]

Fetch_Locations > Check_Location_Count
Check_Location_Count > Add_to_Salesforce: If > 4 locations
Check_Location_Count > Video_Call
Video_Call > WY_Questionnaire: If authorized in Wyoming
Video_Call > Finish_Onboarding: Otherwise, complete onboarding
```

_Explanation:_

- **Fetch_Locations:** Initiates the process by gathering practice location data.
- **Check_Location_Count:** Determines if the number of locations requires additional steps.
- **Add_to_Salesforce:** Integrates with Salesforce if there are more than 4 locations.
- **Video_Call:** Continues with a video call step for further verification.
- **WY_Questionnaire:** Displays a special questionnaire for doctors authorized in Wyoming.
- **Finish_Onboarding:** Concludes the onboarding process when conditions are met.
