  description: >
    Extract the complete text content from the PDF file. {pdf_url}
    Make sure to preserve the document structure as much as possible, including paragraphs, lists, and section headings. Pay special attention to maintaining the hierarchical organization of the content.
  expected_output:
    The complete text content of the PDF document with preserved structure.
    The output should contain all text from the document, organized in a way that maintains the original document flow and organization.

create_section_extraction_task:
  description: >
    Use the extracted output from the previous task present at {pdf_text_url}.
    And then identify and extract the following specific sections: {sections_to_extract}.
    For each section:
    1. Identify the section boundaries accurately
    2. Extract the complete content of each section
    3. Maintain the original formatting within each section
    4. Ensure no content from other sections is included
    The sections may be indicated by headings like "2. Problem" or simply "Problem".
  expected_output:
    '''A structured object containing the extracted sections with the following format:
    {{
    "{sections_to_extract[0]}": "[complete content of section]",
    "{sections_to_extract[1]}": "[complete content of section]",
    "{sections_to_extract[2]}": "[complete content of section]"

create_section_json_to_steps_task:
  description: >
    Use the extracted output from the previous task present at {extracted_text_url} to convert the solution description into a structured JSON for diagram generation.
    Convert the solution description into a structured JSON for diagram generation.
    The JSON should follow this structure:
    {jsonOutput}
    And make sure all the fields are filled in the given json
    Identify all components, their relationships, external systems, and workflow steps from the solution text.
    Use knowledge to give icon names to components and categorize them appropriately.
    Each component should have a unique ID and appropriate categorization.
    Map the relationships between components accurately.
    Define workflow steps based on the implementation process described.
    Set appropriate metadata for the diagram.
    Make sure to not mix Technologies while creating the json.
    Use Basic Ersaser.io icon if there is no technology defined in a particular step.
  expected_output:
    A well-structured JSON object representing the architectural solution.
    The JSON should contain all necessary information to generate a diagram that accurately reflects the solution architecture.

rule_validation_task:
  description: >
    Perform a rule-based validation check on the given system architecture to ensure that:
    Reference for the incompatible teck can be found in this json. {json_url}
    No incompatible technologies are used together.
    The solution adheres to regulatory and security standards.
    The architecture follows basic compatibility guidelines.
  expected_output: >
    A list of detected violations (if any).
    A confirmation message if no violations are found.

json_to_eraser_diagram_task:
  description: >
    Your task is to convert the provided architecture JSON present at {diagram_json_url} into 
    valid Eraser.io diagram code that follows Eraser.io's specific syntax.

    The JSON structure represents a cloud architecture with components, connections, and workflow.

    IMPORTANT: 
    - DO NOT modify or restructure the JSON input
    - DO NOT output JSON - you must output ONLY valid Eraser.io code
    - Each component in the JSON must be represented in the diagram
    - Each connection in the JSON must be represented in the diagram
    - Use the appropriate Eraser.io shape/icon for each component category
    - Follow the exact Eraser.io syntax in your knowledge base
    - Ensure the diagram layout matches the one specified in the JSON

    Before generating code, consult your knowledge base to understand:
    1. Eraser.io code structure for cloud architecture diagrams
    2. How to create groups/containers in Eraser.io
    3. How to properly define connections between components
    4. How to use the appropriate icons for each component type
  expected_output: >
    ONLY valid Eraser.io diagram code that can be directly copied into Eraser.io. 
    Do not include explanations, JSON, or anything other than the Eraser.io diagram code itself.
