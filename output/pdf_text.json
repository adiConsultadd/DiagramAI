Urban Secure Analytics Case Study
1. Client Profile
Client Name: Newport Police Department
Location: New York, US
Newport Police Department operates in urban environments and focuses on enhancing public safety through data‑driven decision‑making. The department emphasizes efficient data integration and actionable analytics to foster strategic operational improvements.

2. Problem
Newport Police Department faced significant challenges with fragmented data systems and time‑consuming manual processes. Critical information was scattered across multiple legacy systems, which impeded timely insights and impacted operational decision‑making. Data consistency issues and delays necessitated a streamlined solution to automate reports and centralize analytics, ensuring ease of use for all team members.

3. Solution Overview
To address these challenges, we developed a comprehensive analytics system that integrated data from disparate sources into a unified, highly secure platform. We deployed Python for custom scripting and advanced analytics, automating data processing and eliminating labor‑intensive tasks. ArcGIS was incorporated to deliver precise geospatial analysis and interactive maps that enhanced location‑based insights. Our web‑based visualization, built with HTML5 and JavaScript frameworks, provided intuitive dashboards that users navigated effortlessly. The solution was securely hosted on AWS, meeting stringent CJIS certification, data encryption standards, and role‑based access controls, which resulted in faster reporting and improved operational clarity.
